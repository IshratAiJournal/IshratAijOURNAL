## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm Ishrat Nawaz, a beginner in coding, learning Python step by step with consistency and curiosity.  
This repo includes my practice projects from FreeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing with Python certification.  
I'm excited to keep learning and improving â€” one line of code at a time! ðŸ’»âœ¨
